      he Central PA Humane Society (CPHS), serving Blair and surrounding counties in central Pennsylvania, is a charitable, non-profit 501(c)(3) organization dedicated to helping animals and people.</p>
      <p>Our mission here at CPHS is to prevent animal neglect and cruelty through education and enforcement while providing a safe haven and finding forever homes for those in need.</p>
      <p>Our adoption programs, our outreach to rescue groups, and our use of foster care have created a flow of animals in and out of our shelter that, more often than not, leaves us with space available. CPHS won’t euthanize for an illness that can be treated, behavior that can be modified, or for a length of stay, providing there is quality of life for the pet.</p>
    </div><div><p>Because definitions such as treatable and modified can vary with each case and we question the need for definitions or catch-phrases, we at CPHS choose to refer to our shelter and the work we do here as “LIFE-SAVING” rather than “No-Kill.”</p>
      <p>The designation of “no-kill” can be applied to any shelter that euthanizes less than 10 percent of their animals a year, for reasons of health and temperament. CPHS has met this designation and has provided a safe haven and forever homes to more than 90% of animals that enter our facility.</p>

      <h2>FAQ</h2>
      <p>Have a question? Here are some frequently asked questions by our community.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq">
    <div>

    <button class="accordion"><span class="bullet"><img src="imgs/print.svg"></span>
    Where does CPHS get the funding to operate?</button>
    <div class="panel">
    <p>CPHS is a non-profit organization, not a municipal or government agency, so we do not receive government funds other than fees for service. We rely solely on donations from our local community to serve our animals and community. We receive no funding from national organizations, such as HSUS or the ASPCA unless we apply for and receive grants.
    </p>
    </div>
  
    <button class="accordion"><span class="bullet"><img src="imgs/print.svg"></span>
    Is CPHS a "no-kill" shelter?</button>
    <div class="panel">
    <p>Some shelters promote that they are “no kill”, which may be misleading or unrealistic. In some cases, humane euthanasia may be necessary due to medical or behavior issues.
    There is no time limit on how long we keep an animal; we do not euthanize based on length of stay. As long as an animal remains medically and behaviorally healthy, it will remain at our shelter until adoption. CPHS is designated as a no kill shelter as our euthanasia rate is well below the 10% required to be deemed no kill.
    </p> </div>


    <button class="accordion"><span class="bullet"><img src="imgs/print.svg"></span>
    What geographic area does CPHS serve?</button>
    <div class="panel">
    <p>CPHS primarily serves Blair County, PA.
    </p> </div>

    <button class="accordion"><span class="bullet"><img src="imgs/print.svg"></span>
    What type of animals does CPHS house?</button>
    <div class="panel">
    <p>The shelter residents include dogs, puppies, cats, kittens and small animals such as rabbits, guinea pigs, ferrets, and hamsters. We occasionally care for reptiles and pot bellied pigs.
    </p>
    </div>

    <button class="accordion"><span class="bullet"><img src="imgs/print.svg"></span>
    What does a CPHS Adoption Package include?</button>
    <div class="panel">
    <p>Our adoption package includes spay/neuter surgery, first round of vaccinations (DHLPP & Bordetella for dogs), FVRCP for cats), a current rabies vaccination, deworming, leukemia & aids test (cats), a shelter ID tag (dogs) and a microchip.
    </p>
    </div>
    
    <button class="accordion"><span class="bullet"><img src="imgs/print.svg"></span>
    I need to surrender my pet, will you help me?</button>
    <div class="panel">
    <p>CPHS assists pet owners in every way possible to prevent them from having to give up their pet. Please call us at (814) 942-5402 so we can help you.
    If you are unable to find a new home for your pet and need to surrender him, acceptance is dependent on space. We do request that you make an appointment before bringing your pet to us. Additionally, a $30 surrender fee is required.</p>
    </div>
    
    <button class="accordion"><span class="bullet"><img src="imgs/print.svg"></span>
    There are stray pets in my neighborhood, will you pick them up?</button>
    <div class="panel">
    <p>For stray dogs please call your local Police, State Police or State Dog Warden. They will either arrange dispatch of a Humane Officer to pick up a stray dog or may be able to offer assistance.
    There is no pick up service for stray cats, but if space allows we can take them into the shelter. Please call to check space availability before bringing a stray cat in.
    </p>
    </div>
    
    <button class="accordion"><span class="bullet"><img src="imgs/print.svg"></span>
    I need to put my pet to sleep, will you help me?</button>
    <div class="panel">
    <p>CPHS does not offer humane euthanasia for the public. We may be able to provide you with a number for a veterinarian in your area that can perform that service. We do have cremation service available for owned pets. Our fees vary based on the size of your pet. Please call our shelter at (814) 942-5402 for more information.
    </p>
    </div>
  </div><div>
    
    <button class="accordion"><span class="bullet"><img src="imgs/print.svg"></span>
    I think someone is abusing/neglecting their pet, what do I do?</button>
    <div class="panel">
    <p>We encourage you to contact the CPHS Humane Officer at (814) 942-3780 to promptly investigate the situation. Complainant information is kept strictly confidential. If the situation is occurring in the City of Altoona, contact Officer Mike Daversa at (814) 949-2499.
    </p>
    </div>

    <button class="accordion"><span class="bullet"><img src="imgs/print.svg"></span>
    Do you board animals?</button>
    <div class="panel">
    <p>No. CPHS provides services for stray and surrendered animals in our community.
    </p></div>


    <button class="accordion"><span class="bullet"><img src="imgs/print.svg"></span>
    Does CPHS provide Free or Low-Cost Verterinary care?</button>
    <div class="panel">
    <p>CPHS does NOT offer veterinarian services for the public. We have a contract veterinarian that services shelter animals only.
    </p>
    </div>

  
    <button class="accordion"><span class="bullet"><img src="imgs/print.svg"></span>
    How can I help the shelter animals at CPHS?</button>
    <div class="panel">
    <p>There are many ways you can help the animals. CPHS has a “wish list” of items regularly used to care for our animals. Donations of your time as a volunteer helps CPHS achieve the tasks needed to operate the shelter and take care of the animals.
    Donations of money help to offset the costs of operating the shelter, such as paying for utilities or buying supplies that haven’t been donated. And, if and when you are able, adopt your next pet from CPHS.</p>
    </div>


    <button class="accordion"><span class="bullet"><img src="imgs/print.svg"></span>
    I'd like to volunteer at CPHS; what jobs are available?</button>
    <div class="panel">
    <p>There are many jobs that you can do, and we welcome you! Opportunities include cage cleaning, clerical duties, laundry, fundraising events, animal socializing, and photography for website and Petfinder account. Please contact our Volunteer Coordinator at (814) 942-5402, for more details.</p>
    </div>

    
    <button class="accordion"><span class="bullet"><img src="imgs/print.svg"></span>
    What can I do to help control the community's pet overpopulation?</button>
    <div class="panel">
    <p>Quite simply, CPHS encourages that you spay or neuter your pets. Monetary donations to our Spay Days program helps us provide lost cost spay / neuter surgeries to pet owners with financial difficulty.
      Also, we respectfully request that you adopt pets from animal shelters. In many cases, we have purebred and “designer” dogs and cats waiting for new homes.</p>
    </div>

  
    <button class="accordion"><span class="bullet"><img src="imgs/print.svg"></span>
    What advice would you give a new pet owner?</button>
    <div class="panel">
    <p>First and foremost, spay or neuter your pet. Take the time to research the breed of animal prior to adopting, since pet ownership is a lifelong commitment.
        Keep your pet up-to-date on all vaccines, not just rabies. Annual checkups are encouraged to keep your pet as healthy as possible.
        Give your pet time to adjust in his new home, and promptly correct behavior issues that may arise. There are many resources to help you with this.
        Make time for exercise and for play.
        Keep ID on your pet at all times, or have your pet microchipped. Also, take pictures of your pet from various angles to help identify your pet if he ever becomes lost.
        Last, but not least, appreciate the unconditional love your pet can bring you!</p>
