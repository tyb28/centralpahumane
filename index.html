      he Central PA Humane Society (CPHS), serving Blair and surrounding counties in central Pennsylvania, is a charitable, non-profit 501(c)(3) organization dedicated to helping animals and people.</p>
      <p>Our mission here at CPHS is to prevent animal neglect and cruelty through education and enforcement while providing a safe haven and finding forever homes for those in need.</p>
      <p>Our adoption programs, our outreach to rescue groups, and our use of foster care have created a flow of animals in and out of our shelter that, more often than not, leaves us with space available. CPHS won’t euthanize for an illness that can be treated, behavior that can be modified, or for a length of stay, providing there is quality of life for the pet.</p>
    </div><div><p>Because definitions such as treatable and modified can vary with each case and we question the need for definitions or catch-phrases, we at CPHS choose to refer to our shelter and the work we do here as “LIFE-SAVING” rather than “No-Kill.”</p>
      <p>The designation of “no-kill” can be applied to any shelter that euthanizes less than 10 percent of their animals a year, for reasons of health and temperament. CPHS has met this designation and has provided a safe haven and forever homes to more than 90% of animals that enter our facility.</p>

      <h3>Volunteer</h3>
      <p>Volunteers are a vital part of the CPHS team. Without them, we would not be able to perform many of the essential functions at our shelter. PHS is always looking for eager volunteers to assist with the shelter animals and everyday responsibilities of shelter life.</p>

      <h3>Foster</h3>
      <p>The Central PA Humane Society relies heavily on foster homes to help them care for the thousands of animals that come into the shelter each year.
        If you can open your heart and your home to an animal in need then please view our foster requirements and then complete your foster application.</p>

      <p>It’s only through donations and fundraising efforts that we are able to do our job each day and bring hope to our many residents. We need the support of our community because CPHS receives little or no governmental support and depends almost entirely on our community and your generosity.</p>

      <h3>Trap-Neuter-Release</h3>
      <p>To help control the feral cat overpopulation problem, CPHS offers Trap-Neuter-Release (TNR).  This is the recommended method nationwide for controlling feral cat colonies. TNR is a planned, humane program for bringing feral cats to the clinic for spaying or neutering and then the cats are released back to where they were found. TNR offers these cats a healthier life in the wild.</p>
